# Container Permission Squasher

üéÉÔ∏èüëäÔ∏è

Since the podman storage driver translates uid/gid 0 to your native ID when it
writes a new image on the filesystem, we need to "flatten permission" or make
everything in the container owned by root! Any other ID would require privileged namespaces.
Given a container you have just built, this action will allow you to flatten permissions
in this manner (and then likely push to a registry for later use).

## Example

Let's say our container is `library/ubuntu` and we want to squash to `ubuntu:squashed`.
We would generate the action as follows:

```yaml
name: Squash Image
on:
  pull_request: []

jobs:
  squash-container:
    name: Squash Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Squash Container
        uses: rse-ops/container-permission-squasher@main
        with:
          container: library/ubuntu
          squashed: ubuntu:squashed
      - name: View images
        run: |
          docker images
          podman images
```

You can see a full example workflow (building a primary container and adding a squashed tag)
in [examples](examples/squash-permissions.yaml).
